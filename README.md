# profile-pictures
Various profile pictures of mine created via generative methods. Intended to be run with processing.js. Scripts are all located in root folder, example outputs in `/output` and outlined below: 

## Letter Variations
![Frame 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45301066/203423277-93ddcd7b-d0ef-43e3-ac9e-b55a239760a0.png)


`letter-variations.js`: generates a graphic based upon a provided curve, `coords`. The curve is repeatedly mutated with a randomly generated value of cosine to the y value, and sin to the x value, with various stroke widths and varying coloring beneath the top curve. Randomly generated squiggles are drawn on top of each curve level. Selection of the colors is up to the user of the script, but form is generated by the code. 
  - `drawSnake`: draws the squiggles ("snakes") via random generation 
  - `setup`: contains the drawing 


# What's next?
- Animating a profile picture would be nice 
- Fluid simulations might be a good way to go
- Want to try brownian motion sometime
- Flocking/emergent behaviour 
- Generating 3d shapes and crossecting them 
- Something more geometric-- 
- Interface so ^ the above simulations might be accessible to non-programmers :)
